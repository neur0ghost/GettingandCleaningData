Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to work on this course project:

1-  Open the R script run_analysis.r using a text editor.

2-  Change the parameter of the setwd function call to the working directory/folder (i.e., the folder where these the R script file is saved).

3-  Run the R script run_analysis.r. 

PS: In line:
system("\"C:/Program Files (x86)/WinRAR/WinRAR/" x paste0("\"", Rhome(), "dataset", "/"))
you may need to switch
"C:/Program Files (x86)/WinRAR/WinRAR/" 
to the path of the location of winzip in your pc.
